Prosthetic Hand 

In this project, we explore the design and implementation of a prosthetic hand that can be controlled using a web-based application with sliders and directional buttons for controlling the fingers and wrist.

Programming Languages - C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Tools and Platforms - Arduino IDE, SOLIDWORKS, EasyEDA, ESP32, Servo driver pca9685, Sg90 servomotors, l298n motor driver, 5V DC gear motors
Mechanical design - https://wikifactory.com/@lphsliyanamana/prosthetic-hand-with-wrist

Future Goals - Add voice control

Our goal is to design a prosthetic hand rich in intuitive 
control mechanisms, allowing users to regain dexterity and 
perform daily tasks more effectively.

Suitability: 
  This prosthetic hand is specifically designed for 
individuals who have a functional hand on one side 
but have lost their hand and wrist from the other 
arm. 
  A functional hand is essential for the control of the 
sliders and directional buttons.
  The forearm of the injured hand should be present 
for the prosthesis to be attached. 
  Not suitable for visually impaired individuals.
  Not suitable for individuals who have lost motor 
skills on their arm and shoulder of the injured hand.
