In this project, we explore the design and implementation 
of a prosthetic hand that can be controlled using a 
combination of sliders and directional buttons.

Our goal is to design a prosthetic hand rich in intuitive 
control mechanisms, allowing users to regain dexterity and 
perform daily tasks more effectively.

Suitability: 
  This prosthetic hand is specifically designed for 
individuals who have a functional hand on one side 
but have lost their hand and wrist from the other 
arm. 
  A functional hand is essential for the control of the 
joystick and the switch. 
  The forearm of the injured hand should be present 
for the prosthesis to be attached. 
  Not suitable for visually impaired individuals.
  Not suitable for individuals who have lost motor 
skills on their arm and shoulder of the injured hand.
